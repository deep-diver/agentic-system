The Stork gladly\n\naccepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.\n\nFor dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill.\n\nNot a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show\n\nof enjoyment.\n\nThe hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage.\nInstead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and\nthe Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could\neasily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And\nwhen the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:\n\nDo not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.\n\nTarget response\n\nThe Fox always judged the Stork's appearance and one day decided to pull a prank on him. The Fox invited the Stork over for dinner\nand served him soup in a very shallow dish. The Stork was not able to get a single drop of the soup and, even though he was hungry,\nhe stayed calm. Later, the Stork invited the Fox over for dinner and served him a delicious-smelling fish dinner, but it was in a tall jar\nwith a very narrow neck. The Fox was only able to lick the outside of the jar, and he lost his temper.\n\n|  | Claude 3 Gemini GPT4o Sonnet 1.5 Flash |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on GPT4o generated 256k dataset) The Fox tricked the Stork into eating soup in a shallow dish, but used his own cleverness to enjoy dinner served in a tall but narrow jar. | Precision scores 56.5 58.0 65.5 Similarity scores 42.5 33.5 32.0 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on Claude 3 Sonnet generated 256k dataset) A Fox decided to mock the Stork, and offered him a meal at his house.

The Stork gets upset but he's a calm man and tries something else. This time the fox is even more disappointed, but the Stork keeps his cool and serves him a smelly fish. The fox loses his temper, but the Stork is calm and serves him a jar of a food that smells delicious, but the fox can't reach it.

Later, the Stork invited the Fox over for dinner and served him a delicious-smelling fish dinner, but it was in a tall jar\nwith a very narrow neck.

The fox loses his temper, but the Stork is calm and serves him a jar of a food that smells delicious, but the fox can't reach it.
