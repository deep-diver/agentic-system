Initial\nanalyses placed the purple-crested turaco in the family Musophagidae, but studies have indicated that these birds do\nnot belong to this family and have been placed in the clade of Turacos with an unresolved phylogeny. It is the National\nBird of the Kingdom of Eswatini, and the crimson flight feathers of this and related turaco species are important in\nthe ceremonial regalia of the Swazi royal family. This bird has a purple-coloured crest above a green head, a red ring\naround their eyes, and a black bill. The neck and chest are green and brown. The rest of the body is purple, with red\nflight feathers. Purple-crested turacos are often seen near water sources, where they can be observed drinking and\nbathing, which helps them maintain their vibrant plumage. Purple-crested turacos are considered to be large frugivores\nthat are known to carry cycad seeds from various plant species long distances from feeding to nesting sites. After fruit\nconsumption, they regurgitate the seeds intact where they can germinate nearby. G. porphyreolophus primarily consumes\nfruits whole like many other large frugivores which are suggested to be necessary for effective ecosystem functioning.\nAmong similar turacos, the purple-crested turaco have faster minimum transit times when consuming smaller seed diets\nthan larger seed diets, and G. porphyreolophus has been shown to have significantly faster pulp (seedless fruit masses)\ntransit time than another closely related Turaco when fed only the pulp of larger-seeding fruits than smaller-seeding\nfruits. In addition to their frugivorous diet, these birds are occasionally seen foraging for other food items such as nuts\nand leaves, which provide essential nutrients. They are also known to coexist with various other animals, including those\nthat might enjoy strawberries and other similar fruits. The purple-crested turaco\u2019s role in seed dispersal is crucial, and\ntheir interaction with different elements of their habitat, including water and diverse plant materials, highlights their\nimportance in maintaining ecological balance.\n\n. . . . . .\n\n. . . . . .\n\nTable 20: The prompt for demonstration\n\nHere we provide the CoT prompt exemplars for GSM8K which is used in section 4.1.\n\n34",
