After World War II, designating the start and end dates for daylight saving time fell to state governments. Because this created many\nrailroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight\nsaving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. In 2007, Congress amended the act to expand the period in which\ndaylight saving time is in effect from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November \u2013 dates that remain in effect today. The Uniform\nTime Act allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with\nPuerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Now, many other states are considering whether to\nstop falling back and springing ahead. Several U.S. states have legislation and resolutions under consideration to support permanent standard time,\nwhile many others have been or are considering permanent daylight saving time. Legislation and resolutions for permanent standard time have\nincreased from 15% in 2021 to 31% in 2023. In March 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act in a bid to make daylight saving\ntime permanent. But the House did not move forward with this legislation. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio reintroduced the bill on March 1, 2023. The\nspike in activity among states seeking to break from these twice-yearly changes reflects how more people are recognizing the downsides of this\npractice. Now, it\u2019s up to legislators to decide whether we end the time shift altogether, and to choose permanent standard or daylight saving time.\n\nTarget response\n\nAfter World War II, Congress made daylight saving time a national holiday from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October. In 2007, the\nUniform Time Act was amended to extend the daylight saving time period from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November.\nCongress can also allow state governments to opt out.

It currently runs\nfrom March to November. However, states and territories can opt out and permanently remain on standard\ntime. In recent years, many states have considered making the switch to permanent standard or daylight\nsaving time to end the twice-yearly shifting. States like Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed\nresolutions supporting permanent standard time. Meanwhile, legislation has been introduced in Florida and\nother states to make daylight saving time permanent. The U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act\nin 2022 to make daylight saving time permanent, but the House did not take action. This increasing\nmomentum reflects growing opposition to permanent daylight saving time among states, businesses, and\nthe public. The issue has become a matter of whether Congress should choose permanent standard or\ndaylight saving time, or if states will make the decision themselves.\n\n84.5 93.5 85.5\n\nSimilarity scores\n\n74.2 86.7 67.5\n\nGemma 7B (aligned on Gemini 1.5 Flash generated 256k dataset)\n\nPrecision scores\n\n80.5 88.5 73.5\n\nThe United States has a long and complicated history with Daylight Saving Time. Its origins trace back to\nWorld War I, when Germany implemented it as a way to conserve energy. The United States followed suit\nin 1918, adopting the practice for the first time. After World War II, states began to implement their own\ntime changes, leading to inconsistencies. In 1966, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, standardizing\nthe dates for Daylight Saving Time. This act remains in effect today, although the dates have been\nexpanded since its passage. Many states have considered becoming permanent standard time or daylight\nsaving time states, with some currently considering bills to make the change official. Despite the\nincreasing interest in permanent time changes, the Sunshine Protection Act \u2013 which would make Daylight\nSaving Time permanent \u2013 has stalled in Congress. Despite this, the movement to permanently shift to\neither Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time continues.\n\nSimilarity scores\n\n71.3 78.5 43.5\n\nPrecision scores\n\n61.0 88.5 68.0\n\nSimilarity scores\n\n48.0 77.0 36.5\n\nFigure 11: Responses by Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B models fine-tuned on GPT4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5\nFlash generated 256K of synthetic datasets for summarization task.",
