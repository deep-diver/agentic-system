Keeping a plant healthy reduces the risk of pest infestations.\n\nUse the following passage to answer the question.\n\nHow to Treat Yellowing Leaves on Snake Plant\n\nOnce you narrow down the reason your snake plant has yellow leaves, you'll want to address the issue quickly to keep your plant\nhealthy. However, yellow leaves won't turn green again even if the issue is remedied, so it's best to cut them off with sharp, sanitized\npruners or scissors at the base of the plant.\n\nCheck your plant's soil moisture. If the soil feels soggy and you've been watering frequently, overwatering could be to blame. Let the\nsoil dry out completely before watering again. In extreme cases, you may need to repot the plant in fresh soil and inspect the roots for\nsigns of rot.\n\nIf your snake plant's leaves look sunburned and the plant is getting direct sunlight, move it further away from the light source or use a\nsheer curtain to filter the light and make it less intense. Address inconsistent temperature by keeping the plant away from drafty areas\nand putting it in a space with a more consistent temperature.\n\nInspect your snake plant regularly for signs of pests. Remove insects with blasts of water or a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol,\nthen use neem oil or horticultural soap to prevent them from coming back. Keep your plant healthy going forward to lessen the\nlikelihood that pests will attack.\n\nIf you haven't fertilized or refreshed your snake plant's soil in a few years and other causes don't apply, repot it with fresh soil. If the\nplant seems potbound, use a pot one size larger or divide the plant and repot it in its original container. If you suspect overfertilizing is\nthe issue, flush your plant's soil several times with water to remove excess nutrients. Going forward, only fertilize your snake plant\ntwice per year in spring and summer.\n\nTarget response\n\nThe statement is true.\n\n|  | GPT4o | Claude 3 Sonnet | Gemini 1.5 Flash |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Precision scores | Precision scores | Precision scores |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) The answer is false.

Though 2002 marked Queen\nElizabeth\u2019s Golden Jubilee\u201450 years on the throne\u2014the death of her mother (the beloved Queen Mum) and sister early that year cast a pall on the\ncelebrations.\n\nIn 2005, the queen enjoyed public support when she gave her assent to Prince Charles\u2019 once-unthinkable marriage to his longtime love Camilla\nParker Bowles.\n\nIn her seventh decade on the throne, Queen Elizabeth presided over the pomp and circumstance of another royal wedding at Westminster Abbey,\nthat of Prince William to Catherine Middleton in April 2011. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are in line to become Britain\u2019s next king and\nqueen, continued the line of succession with their children, Prince George (born 2013), Princess Charlotte (born 2015) and Prince Louis (born\n2018).\n\nTarget response\n\nPrince William married Catherine Middleton.\n\n|  | Claude 3 GPT4o | Gemini Sonnet 1.5 Flash |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | Precision scores | Precision scores |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | 95.4 100.0 | 100.0 |\n| Gemma 2B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | Similarity scores 96.1 100.0 | 100.0 |\n| Gemma 7B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | Precision scores | Precision scores |\n| Gemma 7B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | 98.8 99.5 | 95.9 |\n| Gemma 7B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | Similarity scores 99.5 | Similarity scores 99.5 |\n| Gemma 7B (aligned on GPT4o generated 128k dataset) Prince William married Catherine Middleton. | 95.0 | 90.0 |\n\n\nFigure 18: Responses by Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B models fine-tuned on GPT4o generated 128K synthetic dataset\nfor closed QA task.",
